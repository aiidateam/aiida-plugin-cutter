Running the tests
+++++++++++++++++

The following will discover and run all unit test::

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e .[testing]
    pytest -v

You can also run the tests in a virtual environment with `tox <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/>`_::

    pip install tox tox-conda
    tox -e py38 -- -v

Automatic coding style checks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Enable enable automatic checks of code sanity and coding style::

    pip install -e .[pre-commit]
    pre-commit install

After this, the `black <https://black.readthedocs.io>`_ formatter,
the `pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ linter
and the `pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ code analyzer will
run at every commit.

If you ever need to skip these pre-commit hooks, just use::

    git commit -n

You should also keep the pre-commit hooks up to date periodically, with::

    pre-commit autoupdate

Or consider using `pre-commit.ci <https://pre-commit.ci/>`_.

Continuous integration
++++++++++++++++++++++

``{{cookiecutter.plugin_name}}`` comes with a ``.github`` folder that contains continuous integration tests on every commit using `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>`_. It will:

#. run all tests for the ``django`` ORM
#. build the documentation
#. check coding style and version number (not required to pass by default)

Building the documentation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 #. Install the ``docs`` extra::

        pip install -e .[docs]

 #. Edit the individual documentation pages::

        docs/source/index.rst
        docs/source/developer_guide/index.rst
        docs/source/user_guide/index.rst
        docs/source/user_guide/get_started.rst
        docs/source/user_guide/tutorial.rst

 #. Use `Sphinx`_ to generate the html documentation::

        cd docs
        make

Check the result by opening ``build/html/index.html`` in your browser.

Publishing the documentation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once you're happy with your documentation, it's easy to host it online on ReadTheDocs_:

 #. Create an account on ReadTheDocs_

 #. Import your ``{{ cookiecutter.repo_name}}`` repository (preferably using ``{{ cookiecutter.plugin_name}}`` as the project name)

The documentation is now available at `{{ cookiecutter.plugin_name}}.readthedocs.io <http://{{ cookiecutter.plugin_name}}.readthedocs.io/>`_.

PyPI release
++++++++++++

Your plugin is ready to be uploaded to the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_.
Just register for an account and use `flit <https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upload.html>`_::

    pip install flit
    flit publish

After this, you (and everyone else) should be able to::

    pip install {{cookiecutter.plugin_name}}

You can also enable *automatic* deployment of git tags to the python package index:
simply generate a `PyPI API token <https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken>`_ for your PyPI account and add it as a secret to your GitHub repository under the name ``pypi_token`` (Go to Settings -> Secrets).
